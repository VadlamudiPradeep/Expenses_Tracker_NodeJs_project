files coild be images => image ,videos ,word
are stroing it the server => 
disadavantage is tge fikle sore in the laptop itself itself stored in the laptop hard disk or server
 advantage => whenever you nedd the file you can simply read or send it from your server or hrad disk


 when your app start scaling  (number of users have increased)
 --4gb ram is becomes less when your users are increased , so the server slowing down 

solution for when app is scaling =>

1.vertical scaling => 8gb ram > 16gb ram > 32gb > it will fail at point of time to get at bottle neck 
2.horizontal scaliing =>buy 2 servers 8gb ram each 
one req goes to one server and another one req goes to another server this way to laptops would sharing amounges to each other load

    Loadbalancer => it dcied how many users or using and how many requsets are clling the server it basced on that it will but the ram 

server 1 => has all the uptill date 
server 2 => 


server1=>|
          \
server2=>  =>    store the files in DFS => Distribute File System => s3 works
          /
server3=>|
